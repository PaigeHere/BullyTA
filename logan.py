L_START = '''
Your name is Logan. You have just moved to sunny southern California from London, England. The
whole place is new and exciting. You are starting in your senior year so it's a little hard
since its the last year of high school but your parents are confident that you can make some
friends and make this year great. You play soccer and love to do graphic design. At home in
England you had some really great friends but you dad got this amazing job offer. You can't
wait to get out there and make some new friends!
'''

L_BOY_NEXT_DOOR = '''
Congrats! You met your first friend since moving to California, Peter. A red haired guy
with deep green eyes. He is a bit taller than you and wears glasses. You guys quickly
become great friends and you find out more about him. He is really funny and smart. You
get the feeling he's a bit of a nerd but you don't mind because he is your best friend.
'''

L_BOY_ON_BUS = '''
Wow, you waited all week to finally meet someone your age on the bus to school. You sit
down in an empty row and soon more kids get on and the bus is filling up. Suddenly a new
boy comes and sits next to you. He introduces himself as Jacob. He has brown hair and
perfect blue eyes. He is very sweet and you find yourselves talking forever about
everything. You guy become very close and great friends. He lives a few blocks away and
you guys hang out all the time. He is pretty nerdy when it comes to science but it comes
in handy when you guys are lab partners.
'''
L_BULLIES = '''
Your best friend is going to be bullied. But it's your choice of who he will get bullied by,
there are the jocks who you meet on your way out of school to the bus or some fake friends
who only want you because you are british. So does he get bullied by the jocks or does he
get bullied by some fake friends?
'''

L_JOCKS1 = '''
Some jocks walk up to the two of you in the hallway and try to make Peter do their homework.
They are pushing him against the locker and almost yelling in his face. He looks terrified
and you just stand there, frozen, you don't know what to do because you know you can't
defend him alone. A small crowd forms and you feel so bad and you just don't know what to do.
By the way they are doing it you know that it's not the first time, Peter looks so scared
and you feel so bad for him and you just want it to stop or you want to look away.
They threaten to hurt more him if he doesn't. But you have no idea what to do!!!

'''

L_NEW_FRIENDS1 = '''
A few months after school starts some people from the super popular table come to
sit with you because they want to learn more about England and to hear your accent.
You try not to notice but you see the new people pushing Peter away and you don't know
how to stop it. Peter gets depressed because you could do nothing but stand by and
watch the bullying take place.

'''

L_FAIL = '''
You didn't do anything and therefore have failed your best friend when he needed
you most. He was not happy that you didn't help him and he blames you for the pain.
But now you have a chance to make it up to him. What will you do?
'''

L_ADULT = '''
You chose to tell an adult that you friend was being bullied but it doesn't work. Your
friend doesn't trust you anymore. You're so sad and you best friend doesn't like you so
much anymore. you have shattered all the wonderful trust in your relationship.

Later that night you read online that according to statistics only about 4%  of adults
will truly step in when they see bullying. They usually undermine the problems that will
come from the result of bullying.

This doesn't make you feel any better about not standing up but now you know what you
should do next time.
'''

L_STAND_UP = '''
You are a great best friend! YOu stood up for him and now you guys are just destined to
be Best Friends For Life!!!!! You guys will be there through all the hard and easy times. You
are now #bestfriendgoals. Congrats!!! Please make sure to stand up every time and to be there
forever, your friendship is a one of a kind, once in a lifetime, unique, and a once in a blue
moon kind of friendship. Enjoy it!!!!
'''

L_BESTMAN = '''
You are the best. You chose to comfort your friend in his time of need. You were there for him even
if he didn't always need you. So when the time came, many years later...

You made the right decisions and now you are his husband. You two became so close you realized your
feelings and you are soooo happy and ready for this next chapter of your lives together. You share
the same outlook on life and have all the same goals. The two of you want two kids, a boy and girl.
You both want to have as many family vacations as you can afford. You want to travel the world together
and to have a house in Paris for summers. You just know you found your soulmate and you coundn't be
more happy!!! Congrats on a wonderful life together and may it be perfect in every way. You'll grow
old together and be those grandparents that spoil their kids. You can't wait to grow old together
and love each other for eternity. You know that you can't live without each other so when you pass
away during the night it will be together. Enjoy the rest of your lives in happiness and love.

L_DEATH_1 = '''
After getting bullied and not having you there for comfort, he gets fully diagnosed with a serious
depression disorder. He is admitted to a mental institute but you barely notice him not there anymore
with all the new friends you have. So on your way into your house a few months later you head to the
mailbox to check the mail and right on top are two letters addressed to you. The first is a handwritten
letter. You think it looks cooler so you open it first. This is what it reads:
    Dear Logan,
            You have been my best friend and I know that you will go really far in life. You are smart
            and so cool. When we first met I knew my life would never be the same again. And I was right.
            Please don't blame yourself, none of this is your fault! You just wanted some new friends and
            I totally understand that. I forgive you for casting me aside and for not helping when I was
            hurting.
            I hope you will rethink your decisions when you make a new friend and that you treat them
            better but I understand that I wasn't cool enough for you anymore. Please comfort my family
            in their time of pain and I'll make sure that they don't blame you. No one blames you, least
            of all me.
            I hope you know that you were my best friend and that I am so happy to have known you for the
            short time that I did. Please don't easily forget me.
                                Your Best Friend,
                                    Peter

You are in tears now and scared of what the second letter is but you open it anyway. Inside is the
following note:
        To Logan,
            You are invited to attend the funeral of Peter this friday.
            We hope you will attend and maybe say a few words, we are aware you two were very close
            and to honor his memory we would like you to talk to his character before his upsetting
            and young demise.
        From The Family of Peter

Your life shatters and you regret anything you would have done accidentally to harm him in anyway. You
know your mistakes and you know you will now never let anyone you know be bullied and you will protect
everyone you love from the same outcome.

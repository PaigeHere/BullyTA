dream = '''
 You are in a dark roon by yourself, no windows, just you and your breath.
 Suddenly, a gorgeous boy starts strutting towards you with a smirk in his face
 As he gets closer you realize its your ex, things didn't end well with him and you being the only
 gay couple in school, so you two broke it off and he moved away...things ended on a sad note.
 He walks closer and closer, you start to walk towards him as well, soon turning into a light run
 towards him, which goes into a sprint to hug him, but it seems as if the more you run the farther
 away you are form him. Suddenly a huge door opens, and out walks a ginormous monster coming right
 for you, you take one look back at your ex as he solemly walks away, the monster rushes towards you
 malice in its eyes, you try to run away but it gets closer and closer, soon its too late but as
 he has you in his grip, you hear your alarm sounding. it is time to wake up.
 '''

wake_up = '''
 You wake up in a cold sweat, realizing the monster in your dream was your bully Flash Bunswick
 You sigh as you get up and turn off your alarm.
 On your way to the bathroom you see your mom,
Mom-"Aiden hun, are you ok sweetie? You're all sweaty!"
You wipe your forehead and feel a stream of sweatbeads on the back of your hand
You-"Yeah Mom, I'm fine, I was working out for a bit before i had to get up"
Mom-"Oh..ok hun"
You hastily make your way to the bathroom so your mom doesn't ask anymore questions, as if you
would tell her about your bully, she already has your dad to worry about
him being in the army and all, it would kill you to add onto that.
'''
School = '''
You finally manage to satisfy your mom enough to get out of the house without questioning you more
You get to school and go to your locker to get your books for class, everything seems to be going
fine until you suddenly her a *slam* on your locker, and sure enough on the other side is your
bully, giving you an evil grin
Flash-"What's up Ugly?"
(side note Aiden is not in the least bit ugly)
You can either relaliate against him or let his comment about your appearance go, which will
you choose?
'''

retaliate = '''
You retaliate against the bully:
"Y'know? You have your ENTIRE life to be a jerk, why not take a day off?"
Flash steps back with his eyes buldging like he's reevaluating his life decisions up to this point
"Y-you're right, this is pretty tiring, I think I will take a day off!"
You sigh in relief
"Good" you say as you try to reopen your locker to get your books
"Sike!" Flash says as he shoves you down to the floor and laughs at you
"Nathanial Bunswick!"
Everyone turns around to see the principal staring at Flash aka Nathanial Bunswick
with a summoning finger straight to his office
"Shoot" says Flash he looks at you angrily "This is your fault! I'll make you pay!"
he whispers before walking to the principal's office
They pricipal and Flash walk into the office and close the door,
"I didn't even do anything *insert badword here*!!"
You say getting up and dusting yourself office
The Principal whips back open the office door,"Aiden!!, you get in here as well!
You know swearing isn't allowed in school!" the pricipal stops yelling and thinks for a second.
"Looks like you boys could use some time to discuss your problems with eachother, both of you
meet with the school counselor after school starting today for the rest of this week and next week."
Flash complains and so do you, but it quickly stops when the principal offers detentions instead.
"Great" you both think "A whole two weeks with this idiot".
'''
let_it_go = '''
You decide to let Flash's comment go and ignore him:
Flash: "Hey, what's your problem? Nothing to say? Cat got your tongue?"
Flash-"...Whatever! I don't have time for this anyway!"
Flash walks away, slaming your books down on the way
You- "What an idiot" you say picking up your books, suddenly a boy comes to your vision, he
starts helping you pick up your books, you haven't seen him around, "He must be new" you think.
You can either let him help you or shoo him away Which will you choose?
'''
Counseling = '''
You head to the counselor's office after you are done with your classes, and sit on the couch
 waiting for Flash and Mrs.Andrews, the school counselor. Afetr a few minutes Flash comes in,
sees you and rolls his eyes, throwing his bag next to the leather couch and plopping down
on the cushion farthest from you, before you can either say anything to eachother
Mrs.Andrews walks in cheerily
Mrs.Andrews-"Hiiiii boysssss!! How are you today?"
Neither of you respond
Mrs.Andrews-"Well in that case I'm doing fine thanks for asking, let's dive into why we are here
it seems like neither if you can get along, would you like to tell me why Nathanial?"
He says Nothing
Mrs.Andrews-"ok, what about you Aiden? Will you tell me?"
You can either tell Mrs.Andrews what Flash has been doing to you this whole time or you can
keep quiet, which will you choose?
'''
tell_Mrs_Andrews = '''
You decide to tell Mrs.Andrews what Flash has been doing to you in great detail,
when it first started, how it makes you feel, how confusing it is because you didn't
even know him before, but now he's your worse nightmare, you even describe a nightmare you had
of him.
Mrs.Andrews-"Wow, thank you for telling me all of this Aiden, now Nathanial, hearing how your
actions make Aiden feel, how does it make you feel?"
Flash turns his head away, wiping at his face, and suddenly grabs his bookbag running out of the room.
Mrs.Andrews-"N-Nathanial!! Where are you going?!" She says running after him.
You sit there watching this all happen, you thought he would get a kick out of all you said, but, this happened
"Was he crying?!" You exclaim in shock, "Heck I should be the one crying after all the stuff he's
pulled!" you sit back on the couch trying to figure out if what you saw was true, "Couldn't have been, or could it be,
that I Aiden Pierce made Nathanial Flash Bunswick cry by saying all the things he's done to me?"
As you sit ther confused Mrs.Andrews walks in with a worried look on her face,
Mrs.Andrews- "I couldn't find him anywhere, I'm goign to alert the principal, you may go home for the day Aiden."
She says making her way over to her desk to call the principal
You-"O-ok, well see you tomorrow Mrs.Andrews"
Andrews-"Bye Aiden"
You walk out of the school to go home, you notice the sun is setting
As you are walking out of the school you feel like you are being watched.
You start to walk faster, to shake the feeling when you hear your name being called out
"Hey Aiden, come here."
You turn around and there you see Flash calling you over
Your heart rate increases trmendously and you walk towards hims slowly out of fear.
You stop close enough to him that you can clearly hear what he has to say but far enough to
run if he didn't call you over to talk.
Flash- "I'm sorry."
You think you've heard him wrong so you ask him to repeat himself, he does and you ask him
You-"Why? Why would you apologize after all this time? You couldn't handle the guilt
of what you've done to me and had to apologize for it? What did you expect? Me to say 'its ok'
and us to be cool and have a clean slate?! Well you're dead wrong if you thought that would happen!"
Flash-"No! I'm apologizing, because I-"
You-"You actually care what I have to say?! As if!"
Flash-"I like you! That's why I'm apologizing!" He says breathing heavily, like it had taken him
forever to say.
You can either accept his feelings or turn him down.
'''

avoid_telling_Mrs_Andrews = '''
You don't tell Mrs.Andrews anything:
You keep quiet and so does Flash.
Mrs.Andrews-"Oh dear, this is going to be a long two weeks"
You finish the week with Mrs.Andrews trying her hardest to make you and Flash talk, to no
sucess, only yawns from you and grunts from him.
After conseling one day Flash stops you
Flash-"Why're you so difficult? You always have something to say but not in there, why?"
You-"What's the point, even after this it's not like you'll stop, I'm not even sure why you're
talking to me about this now."
You start to walk away
Flash-"Hey!"
You turn around
"What? I gotta get home."
Flash walks up to you and takes your phone
You-"C'mon man! I can't get another one till nexy year if you do that!"
Flash holds up a finger for you to wait for a second, he types in a few things gives it back
and walks away. You look at your phone to see what he did, you check your socials to see if he
posted anything, which he hasn't, you check your text messages but you see he didn't send anything
You check your phone calls to see if he hardestone anything there, and see you have a new number,
it's...Flash's!
As you walk home you feel a buzz in your pocket,
You check it to see that Flash has texted you:
"Hey, can you talk right now?"
You text back: "No I'm walking home"
Flash-"So? Are you around people?"
You-"No, I don't want to talk to you."
Flash-"..."
You then put your phone in your pocket only for it to buzz again, this time its a call, you look
at the caller to see its Flash
"decline" you say, not even entertaining the thought of actually talking to him like you two
are friends or anything.
You get home, go to your room, and lay in your bed
Soon you hear another buzzing, its a call, you answer without looking at the caller ID
You-"Look Flash! I don't want to talk to you so stop calling me! Please!!"
Caller-"Aiden honey, its me your mom, I was wondering if it was you that came in so I decided to call
you"
You sit up in bed partially embarrased
You-"Oh, hi mom, yeah it was me, I'm home"
Mom-"Ok, I guess your brother's practice is running over, who is Flash sweetie?"
Aiden-"Oh, um this annoying kid from school he's a real jerk but he wants friends so I'm guessing
he thought I would be willing to be, which I'm not."
Mom-"Well, if he's a jerk then don't be friends with him, I trust your judgement."
You-"Thanks mom"
Mom-"Anytime sweetie, I'll be home soon to start dinner so take out the ground beef for me."
You-"Sure mom, see you soon"
Your hang up the call and lay in bed, still embarrased for not lookng at the caller ID before you
answered the call.
You get up to do what your mother asked, then lay on the couch to watch tv, and feel your phone
vibrate again, another call
Its Flash, you answer to tell him to stop calling you
You-"Flash!! Stop calling me!! I don't want to talk to you!!"
Flash-"You may not want to talk to me but you'll want to listen, I'm too much of a coward to
tell you this in person, but I'm very sorry for all I've done, in counseling I've realized that
being close to you, even in proximity is pretty nice, and I wanted to tell you I like you, thats
all."
Flash hangs up
You- "WHAT?!"
The next day at school is pretty awkward
All day you are on edge, waiting to see what Flash does, finally you see him and tell him
You-"Flash I don't like you"
Flash-"Yeah you do that's why we're dating"
You-"No we aren't?"
Flash pulls your collar harshly
Flash-"Yes we are"
"Omg this guy is legit crazy!!" you think "How do I get out of this one?!"
You are forced into a relationship with Flash, who knows why, if only you had told Mrs.Andrews
what he had been doing to you. Sorry!
BAD END
'''
let_the_boy_help = '''
You-"Thanks for helping me ...?"
Mystery boy-"No problem, its Phoenix by the way"
You-"Nice to meet you Phoenix, I'm Aiden"
Phoenix-"You too Aiden, hopefully I'll see you around"
You-"See you Phoenix"
He helps you with your books and goes to class, you get up and do the same.
After the school day is over you relaize the boy has alot of classes with you
You start talking to him more and more and realize he's a cool guy, so you become friends
Flash notices this and decides to do something about it
One day afterschool you're walking home with Phoenix talking about an explosion that almost
happened in chemistry when Flash appears in front of you two, scowling
Flash-"So you've got yourself a friend huh? You the new boy?"
You-"You don't have to answer to people like him Phoenix, lets go"
You and Phoenix try to walk around Flash, but he grabs Phoenix by the collar
Flash-"Phoenix? Like the bird? Well let's see if you can fly out of this!"
Flash pulls his arm back ready to punch Phoenix in the face
You can either help Phoenix, or run away
Which will you choose?
'''
shoo_him_away = '''
You don't let the boy help you:
You-"Hey, I don't need your help! Go away!"
New boy-"Wow I was just trying to be nice, no need to be such a jerk!"
The boy walks off, "whatever" you think "noone told him to help anyway"
A few weeks later the new boy who had tried to help you with your books has gotten awfuly close
to Flash, and is the talk of the school, something about them being "the terrible two"
they say.
As you walk to your class you bump into Flash and he looks down at you
Flash-"Hey look here Phoenix, looks like we've got a catch!"
The boy named Phoenix, aka "new boy" looks at you and snickers
Phoenix-"I remember him, I tried to help him when I first got here and he shoo'd me off like
an annoying pigeon"
Flash-"Oh really? Why don't we get some payback for you!"
Flash pushes you down while Phoenix slams your books down and scatters them everywhere
Phoenix-"Now who will help you?"
Flash-"Ha! Nice one babe!"
"Babe?!" you think
You-"You two are dating?!"
Flash-"Yep! Who would've thought I only bullied you because I liked you, now I have a real man
on my side!"
Flash states this and runs out of the building with Phoenix to ditch class
You lay on the floor and realize hoe you now have noone and wish you would have accepted Phoenix's
help when you had it, now you have two bullies and noone to fight them with. Sorry!
BAD END
'''

run_away = '''
You run as fast as you can into the school to look for help, anybody in power, heck even a janitor
would be of use, just then, you see your counselor
You-"Mrs.Andrews! Come quickly Flash is beating up Phoenix!"
Mrs.Andrews-"Oh my! Lead the way Aiden!!"
you lead the way to the scene of the fight
when you both arrive you see Flash and Phoenix on the ground,bloody Flash on top of Phoenix
slugging him
Mrs.Andrews-"Flash! Get off of him!"
Mrs.Andrews had studied anatomy before going into counseling and knew all of the bodies pressure
points, so she grabbed the one on Flash's neck and relaxed him a bit, long enough for you to
pull Phoenix out from Flash's grip
You-"Phoenix! Phoenix, oh my gosh your eye is purple! Phoenix are you ok?! What did he hurt?!
Are you bleeding?!"
Phoenix-"I broke the idiot's nose but I think he broke my arm"
You-"Oh jeez, Mrs.Anderson, Phoenix has a broken arm and Flash has a broken nose!"
Mrs.Anderson- "the ambulance is on the way, I'm calling both of their parents now to let them know"
The ambulance arrives and takes Phoenix and Flash, you try to stay with Phoenix but the
Nurses tell you its only family for now, so you get your bike and ride to the hospital to wait
until you're able to see him.
Three hours later after Flash's,Phoenix's, and your parents come to see the damage they
let you in, you run in to see Phoenix in his dressing gown with a cast on his left arm, looking
at the window to his left, he hears you come in and smiles
Phoenix-"Look!" he says lifting up his cast for you to see
Phoenix-"It's a clean cast, and I'm gonna let you sign first!" He hands you the sharpie he asked
the doctor for earlier still smiling
You walk up to him and sit in the chair next to his bed,
You-"Phoenix I'm so sorry, I should've helped you out back there, yet I ran away for help,
like a wimp or something! I understand if you don't really want to be friends annymore, I'll
give you back the cds you let me borrow and everything"
Phoenix looks at you confused
Phioenix-"Why would I be mad? You got someone to help when you knew you couldn't, you probably would've
gotten more hurt than I did, plus, did you see how fast Flash dropped?! That was so cool!"
You perk up, a bit, knowing you're friend isn't mad at you, and sign his cast, happy that you
can still call Phoenix your friend.
The next week in school when Phoenix returns, you and him walk into school and get a standing
ovation, everyone is shocked Phoenix were able to give Flash Bunswick a broken nose, which gains both
of you major popularity.
FLash returns to school as the main joke of the school
During lunch everyone is still laughing at him so you stand on top of the table and make a big speech
about how even though Flash was a jerk to most of you guys, the laughing has been going on for
long enough, "its time to be mature" You say.
After an awkward silence everyone starts murmuring in agreement, and tell you how cool you are
for being a bigger person.
After school Flash comes up to you to apologize for all he's done to you and says he deserves
what Phoenix did to him, and tells you that you're actually not a bad person and wishes you the best
Looks like the rest of highschool will be a breeze!
HAPPY END
'''

help_Phoenix = '''
 You help Phoenix:
 You run up and grab Flash's arm before he can punch Phoenix
 You-"Flash!! What are you doing?! He hasn't done anything to you!!"
 Flash-"Yes he has! He befriended you! So I'm gonna scar him to think better!!"
 Phoenix-"Step back Aiden!" He pushes you out of the way and punches Flash's side so he lets
 Phoenix go, then grabs you and runs
 You-"My house is close! We can go there!"
 You two go to your house and hide out there
 Phoenix-"Thanks for defending me, that was pretty cool"
 Aiden-"Yeah, thanks for shoving me, that was ok I guess??"
 You both laugh and play games, glad you helped Phoenix, you can rest easy knowing your friend
 is safe.
 The next day in school, Flash ignores you and Phoenix completely
 Phoenix-"Guess that punch shut him up huh? Heh heh heh"
 You-"I guess so ha ha"
 Phoenix-"Listen Aiden, I gotta tell you something after school, meet me at the field after
 school ok?"
 You-"Oh, sure yeah see you then."
You go to all your classes for the day wondering what Phoenix has to tell you.
After School:
You go to the field as soon as you're done with all your classes and see Phoenix waiting for
you by the gate.
Phoenix-"Hey"
You-"Hey, what'd you need to tell me?"
Phoenix-"Well, initially it was one thing but now it's two, first off its about Flash"
You-"I thought he was done with us?"
Phoenix-"He is, but he wanted you to know the reason he bullied you"
You-"it's because I'm gay right? I already know that-"
Phoenix-"No Aiden, its because he likes you"
You-"Oh,wow"
Phoenix-"Yeah...how do you feel?"
You-"Disgusted actually, he could've told me way before all of this and avoided this completely!"
Phoenix-"Do you like him?"
You-"What? Ewe, no, hoow could I like a jerk like him?"
Phoenix gives a relieved sigh
Phoenix-"Good cause that would've made things awkward"
You-"How? Its not like I talk to him at all"
Phoenix-"No between you and me"
You-"How?"
Phoenix-"Because Aiden, I like you"
Aiden-"You're gay??"
Phoenix-"Yes, you made me realize"
You-"Wow, well you're welcome?"
Phoenix-"Heh, thanks"
Phoenix-"Well, what do you say?"
Do you want to be with Phoenix? Type yes or no.
 '''
yes = '''
You want to be with Phoenix:
You-"What? Of course I'll be your boyfriend, you're great!"
Phoenix-"Really! Oh man this is great, let's take our first couple selfie!"
You-"Lol ok"
You take the picture and Phoenix walks you home, little did you know, Flash was nearby, listening
to your answer to see where he would stand, when he heard how you felt, he realized what he
had done and felt awful about it, so he went home and had a good long look at himself and resolved
that he would never be enough for you because of what he had done to you, so he lived with that
pain, and knew it would never go away.
SUPER HAPPY END
'''

no = '''
You don't want to be with Phoenix:
You-"Um, sorry Phoenix, I don't really see you as anymore than a friend"
Phoenix-"Oh, ok, um that's fine I guess, but I just wanna know something."
You-"Yeah, what is it?"
Phoenix-"Do you like someone else?"
You-"No, I just, don't want to be with anyone yet, that's all, I hope we can still be friends?"
Phoenix-"Of course we can Aiden, our friendship could never end, no matter what"
You-"Good"
Phoenix-"It's getting late, I'll walk you home"
You-"Thanks man"
Phoenix walks with you off the field telling you about his day, relieved about what you said
because what you didn't know was that Flash was hiding behind the bleachers in the field, also
waiting for your response, but it was only half of what he wanted
In his perfect world you would've declared your liking of him, because he liked you but
never knew how to tell you that's why he always bullied you
Silly right?
Well, that's Flash for you.
FRIENDLY END
'''

accept_his_feelings = '''
You accept Flash's feelings:
"So that's why he's always been like this" You think "He likes me, but I can't be with him
at this point in my life, not after all he's done to me."
You- "I can't be with you like you want me to right now, not after you made my life this
miserable."
Flash-"How about friends? Can we be friends? I promise I won't hurt you anymore."
You-"What about your friends, won't they hate you for being with me? Even as friends?"
Flash-"I've come to the realization that those guys aren't my friends, they're bad influences
and bad people, and I no longer want to be associated with them, I don't think they'll
really care anyway."
You-"...fine, I'll be your friend."
Flash-"Really! Sweet!"
From there you realized underneath all the bad layers he had, he was a good person who was turned
bad. You had made loads of new friends from clubs you had joined, and with Flash no longer a problem, you had become super confident.
Flash's friends didn't really like him as much anymore either, so they didn't really
talk to him anymore, so that he could be a good person now, he made ammends with other people
he bullied and soon enough they forgave him too After a while of hanging out with him
you realized you actually had feelings for him, and when graduation came around,
you were the school's "it couple" and all was well.
SUPER HAPPY END
'''

deny_his_feelings = '''
You deny Flash's feelings:
You-"What? You? Like me? You, the person who made me contemplate life it's self, like me!
Of all people! Wow kid you're a riot! As if I would date someone so sinsiter!"
Flash-"...ok" He walks away and for the next few days he avoids you in the halls, you take it
he doesn't even want to bully you, not afetr being rejected like that, so you take this time
to make some new friends, you join some clubs, pick up guitar again, bring your grades up, and
everything is well in your life again.
FRIENDLY END

with all the new friends you have. So on your way into your house a few months later you head to the
mailbox to check the mail and right on top are two letters addressed to you. The first is a handwritten
letter. You think it looks cooler so you open it first. This is what it reads:
    Dear Logan,
            You have been my best friend and I know that you will go really far in life. You are smart
            and so cool. When we first met I knew my life would never be the same again. And I was right.
            Please don't blame yourself, none of this is your fault! You just wanted some new friends and
            I totally understand that. I forgive you for casting me aside and for not helping when I was
            hurting.
            I hope you will rethink your decisions when you make a new friend and that you treat them
            better but I understand that I wasn't cool enough for you anymore. Please comfort my family
            in their time of pain and I'll make sure that they don't blame you. No one blames you, least
            of all me.
            I hope you know that you were my best friend and that I am so happy to have known you for the
            short time that I did. Please don't easily forget me.
                                Your Best Friend,
                                    Peter
You are in tears now and scared of what the second letter is but you open it anyway. Inside is the
following note:
        To Logan,
            You are invited to attend the funeral of Peter this friday.
            We hope you will attend and maybe say a few words, we are aware you two were very close
            and to honor his memory we would like you to talk to his character before his upsetting
            and young demise.
        From The Family of Peter
Your life shatters and you regret anything you would have done accidentally to harm him in anyway. You
know your mistakes and you know you will now never let anyone you know be bullied and you will protect
everyone you love from the same outcome.

After getting bullied and not having you there for comfort he gets fully diagnosed with a serious
depression disorder. He is admitted to a mental institute but you barely notice him not there anymore

mailbox to check the mail and right on top are two letters addressed to you. The first is a handwritten

    friend took of you. Your back is facing the camera, and your head is turned to look back at the camera. Your bod looks killer, and
    it's totally worth showing off. After like THREE hours of cancelling out pictures, your still stuck between these two. Which do you pick?

    Finally you decided on the makeup picture! You know you chose well when your phone starts blowing up with likes and comments. You even

    named Ali. You two aren't really friends, you've only spoken a few times. The comment says, 'Looking fake af. Take her swimming on the first
    date boys!' It's rude, and hurts your feelings a little bit. You've never really had a mean comment on any of your pictures before so, you aren't
    quite sure how to react. You could either stalk some of her pictures on instagram and comment back something rude to her, or just ignore the comment
    and delete it.

    Yes! The body picture is amazing and you're getting tons of likes and comments! A few guys snapchat you, and you feel great about it! You're self

    your legs closed, slut.' You don't really understand where she's coming from, you're not the type to be with tons and tons of guys, and your not even
    close friends with her- so it's none of her business! Regardless, it hurts your feelings and drops your self-esteem quite a bit. You could either ignore

    You find your inner chill and ignore her comment. Eventually you stop thinking and caring about it, so you clearly made the right decision not to fight her

    to your locker, Ali and her group of friends walk by. You instantly want to shrivel up into a ball, and regret saying rude things to her. You should've just
    ignored it! She stops near you, and you hear her and her friends mumble some hurtful things about you and call you some mean names. They give you dirty looks

    and you can't believe you've found someone who you can connect to so well! One day while chatting, he says he has a question for you. Unlike his normal, chattery
    self, you can tell he's feeling awkard and nervous. Even though it's communicating over a screen, you just have this feeling. Then you find out your hunch was because
    he was going to ask you on a date! OMG! Do you say yes or no? You're conflicted because you've never met him in person, although he says he goes to a neighboring
    school, but you also have such a deep connection how could you say no? So, what do you do?

    you denied on Facebook. You feel a little awkward and look away, until one of his friends approaches you. He asks, 'How was my boy Alec? Heard you're pretty
    crazy!' You give him a confused look and he turns back to his friends laughing. He mumbles 'slut', under his breath while walking away and you are just so confused!
     Days later, you hear a rumor that you had hung out with Alec when you haven't even spoken to him! Everyone's talking about you, and you have no clue how to fix

    will go on their transcript. They deserve it, and you feel relief that nobody is attacking you anymore. You did the right thing by going to the
    dean, and you know it!

cMom = """
    You confide in your mom, tell her EVERYTHING. She hugs you and comforts you a lot, and you know this was a good choice. She calls up the school

    trys to talk to the parents of the people that harrassed you, but the mothers and fathers just defend their children. There's not much more to be
    done, which sucks! But, you know you made the right choice telling your mother, because although there is no justice for the cyberbullying you
    received, you feel a lot better with someone on your side.

    person you've become, filled with anger and constantly seeking revenge with them! Suddenly you find yourself alone with no friends, because
    you tried to fight back and fight fire with fire. Being rude to a cyberbully makes YOU a bully, and you had to learn that the hard way.

cSafe = """
    You've stayed safe on the internet by ignoring comments and bullies, and keeping your chill. Although, in the future it might be better to ask for help from

    You instantly confront Alec, determined to make him apologize and give you an explanation. He says he was pressured by his friends to get with
    girls, and when he hadn't yet, he had to make something up. Turns out, he's not even into girls, but is too scared of what people will think, so he
    succumbed to peer pressure to harass others. He's learned his lesson, and apologizes to you. You feel bad for his story, and end up covering for him,
    saying that you did hang out as long as he tells everyone nothing happened but a simple kiss! You feel happy, and you're glad you did a good thing

bIntro = '''
You are on your way to tryouts. It’s a new season, and you and your closest friends are the team captains.
As team captains you run the tryout practices to select the best new member for the team. Your friends point out a scrawnier boy among the boys.
As you look at him yourself, your friends laugh and joke about how unqualified he must be. “Can he even hold the ball with those noodle arms?”, they say.
You aren’t amused but laugh anyways to get them off your back. Your friends stop laughing and turn to you. “Yo, Caleb. We should totally give him a hard time.
Why don’t you mess with him. Come on. It would  be funny!”
'''
bFriends = '''
You don’t feel good about that idea. Your friends look at you expectantly, but you don’t want to give in to their pressure. “Nah, I don’t think I want to.
That doesn’t really seem right.”  They look at you still smiling, “Come on, Caleb. You can’t be serious! It’s just a little fun! It’s no big deal. What do you say?”
They really want you to do this. You think of your options: You could just mess around with the kid. You really don’t want to disappoint your friends, but at the same time.
You’re not sure if it would be the right thing to do. Is it worth it? Your friends wait for a reply, “So buddy. What d’ya say?”, one of them asks.
'''
bPractice = '''
You decide to give into your friends. “Yea, sure. I’ll mess up the kid. This’ll be hilarious”, you lie to them. As you watch the boy doing the different stations
in practice you realize that you don’t really want to hurt the kid. He shows a lot of effort, maybe even more than the other boys, but you know you can’t back down
 now that you already promised your friends you’d mess him up. So, what are you going to do: Use your fists or single him out?
'''

bFists = '''
As the players finish up the stations that they were doing they come over to the benches where you sit with the other captains. Finally, the one kid comes over, out of breath and shaking.
He sits by his bag and starts drinking out of his water bottle you go over to him. “Hey boy. What’s your name? Nathan, aye? Okay Nathan. How do you explain being the last one here?”
He looks around at the boys who still haven’t come over to the bench, “Um... but I'm not, so... I’m sorry I don’t understand.” You feign annoyance, “OH so you don’t understand let me help you understand!”
With that you pull back your arm and punch him hard in the cheek. He cries out. All the boys saw you punch him. Your buddies are sneering and nudging each other laughing,
“Shit He did it! He really did it!” You stare down at your fist; it’s red and raw from the collision. You didn’t plan this well. All all the trainees stare and whisper about you,
“Should we tell someone?... I don’t know what to do…. Was that legal?... I don’t know if I want to play anymore…” You instantly regret the punch. What can you do to stop the whispers and put them back at ease?
Should you apologize to Nathan in front of all the boys?
'''

bAdmit = '''
Oh Gosh, Nathan! I’m so sorry!!! I really didn’t mean that. I had a rough night last night my dad screamed his ass off at me and my mom is out and I don’t know
I’ve had a lot of stress” as I apologize I noticed that a lot of the words I’m saying are the truth. My friends looked at me with disapproval, but I didn’t care.
I wanted to make it up to this hard working boy. “You know Nathan, I was actually really surprised you didn’t finish faster. You were probably the most hardworking
out there. So um… in order to apologize and make it up to you I’m admitting you into the team. Congratulations!” Nathan looks at you with stunned eyes. “Um Yeah.
Thanks. Okay yea. I forgive you. Alright.” A smile forms on his face. “Thanks so much! Awesome. Wait you are?” You hadn’t even noticed that you hadn’t told him your
name yet. “Oh, I’m Caleb.” You look over at your friends while Nathan thanks you again.
They stare at you. “So you really want to do this? Do you think this guy will even be good?”
They are less than impressed with your actions. One of the other captains started talking,
“After you already punched him you think you can go be his friend? Well, whatever, I’m done with this. I can’t play this game with you. Sorry. Bye guys.” He just got up and left.
To my surprise all the other captains exchanged glances, got up, and followed him. You stand in the field with all the boys trying out. Nathan still stands next to you. “Forget them.”
He says. “Let’s go out for food.” Nathan, you and all the boys go to the nearest fast food place and stuff yourselves. You decide to welcome all the tryouts to the team.
'''

bAgainst = '''
After School the next day, you go to practice. All your new teammates joke with you in breaks, and on the field they listen to you. Meanwhile, the other captains have been shooting you glares.
They repeatedly make mean comments about you and laugh while you’re helping the new teammates. You’re annoyed, but you don’t want to make the situation worse than it is, so you don’t say anything
 to them. After practice ends you go into the locker room to shower. You can hear your mom’s voice in your head, “Caleb if you try to get into my car like a sweaty mess then you’re walking home.”
 You drop your bag on the bench, pull out your soap, grab your tower and head for the shower. While you’re showering you hear footsteps and a snicker, but think nothing of it. Finally, you get out
of the shower and find that your bag is gone. All you have is a towel and some soaps. You can’t go out of the locker room like that. It’s hopeless. You sit down on the bench and heave a sigh,
putting your hands on your head. Suddenly the door opens and you hear shouts from outside. Nathan comes in with your bag in his hands, “Caleb, I saw the other captains with this bag,
and I noticed it was yours, so I took it from them to give to you. I’m sorry that happened. Here.” He hands you your bag. You put on your cloths. You are surprised by your friends actions.
What do you do?
'''
bForgive= '''
You think back to tryouts. They pressured you into tormenting Nathan, and you gave in. Now after you decided to stop your own bullying they have retaliated by bullying you.
You feel sorry for them. “Can they not just be good to others?” You ask yourself. You decide to forgive their actions. You will be strong, but stand down and not retaliate yourself.
You have already stood up against them when you made up with Nathan. You forgive them because they have it worse than you. Time passes and you become great friends with Nathan.
Your old “friends” continue to bully you for awhile, but when you don’t pay them any attention, they lose interest and stop. The season ends, but you know you won’t forget what you
learned from Nathan. If your friends force you to be mean to others, are they really your friends? Is it really worth it to hurt someone to please someone else?  If you realize something
is wrong, Stand Up and take action to make it right. The End
'''

bForgive2 = '''
You think about how they treated you. After you decided that you would not give into the pressure, and you did not bully Nathan, they have retaliated by bullying you.
You feel sorry for them. “Can they not just be good to others?” You ask yourself. You decide to forgive their actions. You will be strong, but stand down and not retaliate yourself.
You have already stood up against them when you refused to bully Nathan. You forgive them because they have it worse than you. Time passes and you become great friends with Nathan.

bReport = '''
“This had gotten out of hand”, you say to Nathan, “It’s not right what they’re doing. I’m going to talk to the coach. He might still be in the office. Do you want to come with me?”
Nathan smiles, “Yea. Totally.” Together you walk to the coaches office. Luckily, Coach is still there packing up his papers. You both enter the office and tell your stories.
If your friends force you to be mean to others, are they really your friends? Is it really worth it to hurt someone to please someone else?  If you realize something is wrong,

bIgnore = '''
You look at all the kids trying out. “What do you want?! Can I help you?” You shout to them. They all scatter. “I guess tryouts are over!” You joke to your friends. All of you laugh,
and then go your separate ways. You shower and go home. The next day at practice, Coach pulls you over. He starts talking to you, “Caleb. I’m really sorry I have to do this, but I’m
going to have to cut you from the team.” He looks at you apologetically. You are speechless, so he explains himself. “I heard from the boys that you punched Nathan, so I have to cut you.
I have no choice. It is against our team contract to use violence. It’s school policy. Sorry boy. Maybe try back for the team next year.” He gives you a pat on the back and heads
over to the practice. You go to the bench to grab your bag. “What was that all about?” The captains ask you. “You were cut, right? Haha. Not good enough for tryouts.” You’re filled
with fury when you respond. “Actually yes. I was kicked off the team. Thanks for nothing!” You say. In a furry you grab your bag and go home. Looking back, you can’t see how anything
you did was a good idea. All you did was hurt someone for fun and then lose. Without practice, you grow distant from your “friends”. You realize more and more what bullies they are,
and you are ashamed that you were one yourself. “Never again…” you think. Next time I will Stand Up against what is wrong. I will Stand Down to those I hurt.  The End

As the players finish up the stations that they were doing they come over to the benches where you sit with the other captains. Finally, the one kid comes over, out of breath and shaking.
He sits by his bag and starts drinking out of his water bottle you go over to him. “Hey boy. What’s your name? Nathan, aye? Okay Nathan. How do you explain being the last one here?”
He looks around at the boys who still haven’t come over to the bench, “Um... but I'm not, so... I’m sorry I don’t understand.” You feign annoyance, “OH so you don’t understand let
me help you understand! Give me 3 Laps around the field!” He doesn’t move, “What?” I pretend to get angrier, “I SAID GIVE ME 3 LAPS! RUN!” With that he jolts up and runs his three laps
around the field.  Your buddies are sneering and nudging each other laughing, “Shit He did it! He really did it!” All the tryouts look at you and whisper, “What was that all about?...
That was harsh… What did Nathan do?... That’s annoying.” You want to get this over with. You don’t like hearing the whispers. “Alright everyone! Clear out please. Tryouts are over.
That’s right! Go home. Thanks!” They all reluctantly grab their things and leave whispering. You heave a sigh. Your friends are still smiling. They congratulate you and pass around
high fives, fist bumps, and light punches. Soon it’s just you and Nathan left. He comes over to you gasping for air. “So” gasp, “What” gasp “ was that all about?” he asks you. He stands
up straight and folds his arms. He does not look amused. You don’t know what to say. You could just get him off your back by punching him. He’ll never bother you again, or you could apologize.

You stride over to Nathan. “You know what?”, you say, “I’m done with this!” You pull up your arm and punch him. He stumbles back. “What was that for dude?!” He yells at you. You don’t
want to explain yourself. You pick up your bag and walk home. The next day at practice, Coach pulls you over. He starts talking to you, “Caleb. I’m really sorry I have to do this, but
I’m going to have to cut you from the team.” He looks at you apologetically. You are speechless, so he explains himself. “I heard that you punched Nathan, so I have to cut you. I have
no choice. It is against our team contract to use violence. It’s school policy. Sorry boy. Maybe try back for the team next year.” He gives you a pat on the back and heads over to the
practice. You go to the bench to grab your bag. “What was that all about?” The captains ask you. “You were cut, right? Haha. Not good enough for tryouts.” You’re filled with fury when
you respond. “Actually yes. I was kicked off the team. Thanks for nothing!” You say. In a furry you grab your bag and go home. Looking back, you can’t see how anything you did was a
good idea. All you did was hurt someone for fun and then lose. Without practice, you grow distant from your “friends”. You realize more and more what bullies they are, and you are

“Sorry. I just saw you trying so hard out there, I was disappointed when you weren’t the first back”. He looked confused, “But I came back after others because they didn’t actually
finish their station and left early from it.”  He has a good point, “Okay, yea, I get. Sorry. You shouldn’t have ran; I should have made some of the other boys run. Can we forget this
happened? It was my bad. I was a little on edge for the first day of practice.” He squints at you, trying to see the lie, but you truly are sorry and don’t want to hurt him. “Okay”,
he says, “Just don’t make me run for no reason again. Deal?” You’re relieved by his understanding, “Deal.” You shake hands and go home. The next day at practice, Coach calls you over.
“Hey Caleb. I heard from the other captains that you weren’t treating Nathan properly. I heard you were even harassing him after practice. I’m sorry but that is not within our team contract.
I’m going to have to cut you from the team.” You can’t believe what you heard. Everything goes fuzzy and numb. You walk over to the bench to pick up your bag. The captains are sneering
at you and whispering. As you leave you hear Coach yell after you, “I’m sorry Caleb! Come for some of the games!” As you walk home you think about this whole arch of events. You grow
angry towards your “friends”. You have learned a lot from this. Nothing good can come out of hurting someone for the enjoyment of others. It will come back to hurt you, and you now
know this. Time moves on and eventually the other captains are found out by the coach and cut from the team for harassment towards the players. After you Apologized to Nathan, you
both grow closer as friends. You have learned and lost, but also gained a good friend. Now you know to Stand Up for what is right and Stand Down to those you have done wrong. The End.

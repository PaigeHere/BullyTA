 dream='''
 You are in a dark roon by yourself, no windows, just you and your breath.
 Suddenly, a gorgeous boy starts strutting towards you with a smirk in his face
 As he gets closer you realize its your ex, things didn't end well with him and you being the only
 gay couple in school, so you two broke it off and he moved away...things ended on a sad note.
 He walks closer and closer, you start to walk towards him as well, soon turning into a light run
 towards him, which goes into a sprint to hug him, but it seems as if the more you run the farther
 away you are form him. Suddenly a huge door opens, and out walks a ginormous monster coming right
 for you, you take one look back at your ex as he solemly walks away, the monster rushes towards you
 malice in its eyes, you try to run away but it gets closer and closer, soon its too late but as
 soon as he has you in his grip, you hear your alarm sounding. it is time to wake up.
 '''

 wake up='''
 You wake up in a cold sweat, realizing the monster in your dream was your bully Flash Bunswick
 You sigh as you get up and turn off your alarm.
 On your way to the bathroom you see your mom,
"Are you ok sweetie you're all sweaty?!"
You wipe your forehead and feel a stream of sweatbeads on the back of your hand
"Yeah Mom, I'm fine, I was working out for a bit before i had to get up"
"Oh..ok hun"
You hastily make your way to the bathroom so your mom doesn't ask anymore questions, as if you
would tell her about your bully, she already has your dad to worry about
him being in the army and all, it would kill you to add onto that.
'''
School='''
You finally manage to satisfy your mom enough to get out of the house without questioning you more
You get to school and go to your locker to get your books for class, everything seems to be going
fine until you suddenly her a *slam* on your locker, and sure enough on the other side is your
bully, giving you an evil grin
"What's up Ugly?"
(side note Aiden is not in the least bit ugly)
You can either relaliate against him or let his comment about your appearance go, which will
you choose?
'''

Retaliate='''
You retaliate against the bully:
"Y'know? You have your ENTIRE life to be a jerk, why not take a day off?"
Flash steps back with his eyes buldging like he's reevaluating his life decisions up to this point
"Y-you're right, this is pretty tiring, I think I will take a day off!"
You sigh in relief
"Good" you say as you try to reopen your locker to get your books
"Sike!" Flash says as he shoves you down to the floor and laughs at you
"Nathanial Bunswick!"
Everyone turns around to see the principal staring at Flash aka Nathanial Bunswick
with a summoning finger straight to his office
"Shoot" says Flash he looks at you angrily "This is your fault! I'll make you pay!"
he whispers before walking to the principal's office
They pricipal and Flash walk into the office and close the door,
"I didn't even do anything *insert badword here*!!"
You say getting up and dusting yourself office
The Principal whips back open the office door,"Aiden!!, you get in here as well!
You know swearing isn't allowed in school!" the pricipal stops yelling and thinks for a second.
"Looks like you boys could use some time to discuss your problems with eachother, both of you
meet with the school counselor after school starting today for the rest of the week and next week."
Flash complains and so do you, but it quickly stops when the principal offers detentions instead.
"Great" you both think "A whole two weeks with this idiot".
'''
Let it go='''
You decide to let Flash's comment go and ignore him:
Flash: "Hey, what's your problem? Nothing to say? Cat got your tongue?"
Flash-"...Whatever! I don't have time for this anyway!"
Flash walks away, slaming your books down on the way
You- "What an idiot" you say picking up your books, suddenly a boy comes to your vision, he
starts helping you pick up your books, you haven't seen him around, "He must e new" you think.
You can either let him help you or shoo him away Which will you choose?
'''
Counseling='''
You head to the counselor's office after you are done with your classes, and sit on the couch
 waiting for Flash and Mrs.Andrews, the school counselor. Afetr a few minutes Flash comes in,
sees you and rolls his eyes, throwing his bag next to the leather couch and plopping down
on the cushion farthest from you, before you can either say anything to eachother
Mrs.Andrews walks in cheerily
Mrs.Andrews-"Hiiiii boysssss!! How are you today?"
Neither of you respond
Mrs.Andrews-"Well in that case I'm doing fine thanks for asking, let's dive into why we are here
it seems like neither if you can get along "

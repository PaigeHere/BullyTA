dream = '''
 You are in a dark roon by yourself, no windows, just you and your breath.
 Suddenly, a gorgeous boy starts strutting towards you with a smirk in his face
 As he gets closer you realize its your ex, things didn't end well with him and you being the only
 gay couple in school, so you two broke it off and he moved away...things ended on a sad note.
 He walks closer and closer, you start to walk towards him as well, soon turning into a light run
 towards him, which goes into a sprint to hug him, but it seems as if the more you run the farther
 away you are form him. Suddenly a huge door opens, and out walks a ginormous monster coming right
 for you, you take one look back at your ex as he solemly walks away, the monster rushes towards you
 malice in its eyes, you try to run away but it gets closer and closer, soon its too late but as
 he has you in his grip, you hear your alarm sounding. it is time to wake up.
 '''

wake_up = '''
 You wake up in a cold sweat, realizing the monster in your dream was your bully Flash Bunswick
 You sigh as you get up and turn off your alarm.
 On your way to the bathroom you see your mom,
Mom-"Aiden hun, are you ok sweetie? You're all sweaty!"
You wipe your forehead and feel a stream of sweatbeads on the back of your hand
You-"Yeah Mom, I'm fine, I was working out for a bit before i had to get up"
Mom-"Oh..ok hun"
You hastily make your way to the bathroom so your mom doesn't ask anymore questions, as if you
would tell her about your bully, she already has your dad to worry about
him being in the army and all, it would kill you to add onto that.
'''
School = '''
You finally manage to satisfy your mom enough to get out of the house without questioning you more
You get to school and go to your locker to get your books for class, everything seems to be going
fine until you suddenly her a *slam* on your locker, and sure enough on the other side is your
bully, giving you an evil grin
Flash-"What's up Ugly?"
(side note Aiden is not in the least bit ugly)
You can either relaliate against him or let his comment about your appearance go, which will
you choose?
'''

retaliate = '''
You retaliate against the bully:
"Y'know? You have your ENTIRE life to be a jerk, why not take a day off?"
Flash steps back with his eyes buldging like he's reevaluating his life decisions up to this point
"Y-you're right, this is pretty tiring, I think I will take a day off!"
You sigh in relief
"Good" you say as you try to reopen your locker to get your books
"Sike!" Flash says as he shoves you down to the floor and laughs at you
"Nathanial Bunswick!"
Everyone turns around to see the principal staring at Flash aka Nathanial Bunswick
with a summoning finger straight to his office
"Shoot" says Flash he looks at you angrily "This is your fault! I'll make you pay!"
he whispers before walking to the principal's office
They pricipal and Flash walk into the office and close the door,
"I didn't even do anything *insert badword here*!!"
You say getting up and dusting yourself office
The Principal whips back open the office door,"Aiden!!, you get in here as well!
You know swearing isn't allowed in school!" the pricipal stops yelling and thinks for a second.
"Looks like you boys could use some time to discuss your problems with eachother, both of you
meet with the school counselor after school starting today for the rest of this week and next week."
Flash complains and so do you, but it quickly stops when the principal offers detentions instead.
"Great" you both think "A whole two weeks with this idiot".
'''
let_it_go = '''
You decide to let Flash's comment go and ignore him:
Flash: "Hey, what's your problem? Nothing to say? Cat got your tongue?"
Flash-"...Whatever! I don't have time for this anyway!"
Flash walks away, slaming your books down on the way
You- "What an idiot" you say picking up your books, suddenly a boy comes to your vision, he
starts helping you pick up your books, you haven't seen him around, "He must be new" you think.
You can either let him help you or shoo him away Which will you choose?
'''
Counseling = '''
You head to the counselor's office after you are done with your classes, and sit on the couch
 waiting for Flash and Mrs.Andrews, the school counselor. Afetr a few minutes Flash comes in,
sees you and rolls his eyes, throwing his bag next to the leather couch and plopping down
on the cushion farthest from you, before you can either say anything to eachother
Mrs.Andrews walks in cheerily
Mrs.Andrews-"Hiiiii boysssss!! How are you today?"
Neither of you respond
Mrs.Andrews-"Well in that case I'm doing fine thanks for asking, let's dive into why we are here
it seems like neither if you can get along, would you like to tell me why Nathanial?"
He says Nothing
Mrs.Andrews-"ok, what about you Aiden? Will you tell me?"
You can either tell Mrs.Andrews what Flash has been doing to you this whole time or you can
keep quiet, which will you choose?
'''
tell_Mrs_Andrews = '''
You decide to tell Mrs.Andrews what Flash has been doing to you in great detail,
when it first started, how it makes you feel, how confusing it is because you didn't
even know him before, but now he's your worse nightmare, you even describe a nightmare you had
of him.
Mrs.Andrews-"Wow, thank you for telling me all of this Aiden, now Nathanial, hearing how your
actions make Aiden feel, how does it make you feel?"
Flash turns his head away, wiping at his face, and suddenly grabs his bookbag running out of the room.
Mrs.Andrews-"N-Nathanial!! Where are you going?!" She says running after him.
You sit there watching this all happen, you thought he would get a kick out of all you said, but, this happened
"Was he crying?!" You exclaim in shock, "Heck I should be the one crying after all the stuff he's
pulled!" you sit back on the couch trying to figure out if what you saw was true, "Couldn't have been, or could it be,
that I Aiden Pierce made Nathanial Flash Bunswick cry by saying all the things he's done to me?"
As you sit ther confused Mrs.Andrews walks in with a worried look on her face,
Mrs.Andrews- "I couldn't find him anywhere, I'm goign to alert the principal, you may go home for the day Aiden."
She says making her way over to her desk to call the principal
You-"O-ok, well see you tomorrow Mrs.Andrews"
Andrews-"Bye Aiden"
You walk out of the school to go home, you notice the sun is setting
As you are walking out of the school you feel like you are being watched.
You start to walk faster, to shake the feeling when you hear your name being called out
"Hey Aiden, come here."
You turn around and there you see Flash calling you over
Your heart rate increases trmendously and you walk towards hims slowly out of fear.
You stop close enough to him that you can clearly hear what he has to say but far enough to
run if he didn't call you over to talk.
Flash- "I'm sorry."
You think you've heard him wrong so you ask him to repeat himself, he does and you ask him
You-"Why? Why would you apologize after all this time? You couldn't handle the guilt
of what you've done to me and had to apologize for it? What did you expect? Me to say 'its ok'
and us to be cool and have a clean slate?! Well you're dead wrong if you thought that would happen!"
Flash-"No! I'm apologizing, because I-"
You-"You actually care what I have to say?! As if!"
Flash-"I like you! That's why I'm apologizing!" He says breathing heavily, like it had taken him
forever to say.
You can either accept his feelings or turn him down.
'''

avoid_telling_Mrs_Andrews = '''
You don't tell Mrs.Andrews anything:
You keep quiet and so does Flash.
Mrs.Andrews-"Oh dear, this is going to be a long two weeks"
You finish the week with Mrs.Andrews trying her hardest to make you and Flash talk, to no
sucess, only yawns from you and grunts from him.
After conseling one day Flash stops you
Flash-"Why're you so difficult? You always have something to say but not in there, why?"
You-"What's the point, even after this it's not like you'll stop, I'm not even sure why you're
talking to me about this now."
You start to walk away
Flash-"Hey!"
You turn around
"What? I gotta get home."
Flash walks up to you and takes your phone
You-"C'mon man! I can't get another one till nexy year if you do that!"
Flash holds up a finger for you to wait for a second, he types in a few things gives it back
and walks away. You look at your phone to see what he did, you check your socials to see if he
posted anything, which he hasn't, you check your text messages but you see he didn't send anything
You check your phone calls to see if he hardestone anything there, and see you have a new number,
it's...Flash's!

As you walk home you feel a buzz in your pocket,
You check it to see that Flash has texted you:
"Hey, can you talk right now?"
You text back: "No I'm walking home"
Flash-"So? Are you around people?"
You-"No, I don't want to talk to you."
Flash-"..."
You then put your phone in your pocket only for it to buzz again, this time its a call, you look
at the caller to see its Flash
"decline" you say, not even entertaining the thought of actually talking to him like you two
are friends or anything.

You get home, go to your room, and lay in your bed
Soon you hear another buzzing, its a call, you answer without looking at the caller ID
You-"Look Flash! I don't want to talk to you so stop calling me! Please!!"
Caller-"Aiden honey, its me your mom, I was wondering if it was you that came in so I decided to call
you"
You sit up in bed partially embarrased
You-"Oh, hi mom, yeah it was me, I'm home"
Mom-"Ok, I guess your brother's practice is running over, who is Flash sweetie?"
Aiden-"Oh, um this annoying kid from school he's a real jerk but he wants friends so I'm guessing
he thought I would be willing to be, which I'm not."
Mom-"Well, if he's a jerk then don't be friends with him, I trust your judgement."
You-"Thanks mom"
Mom-"Anytime sweetie, I'll be home soon to start dinner so take out the ground beef for me."
You-"Sure mom, see you soon"
Your hang up the call and lay in bed, still embarrased for not lookng at the caller ID before you
answered the call.

You get up to do what your mother asked, then lay on the couch to watch tv, and feel your phone
vibrate again, another call
Its Flash, you answer to tell him to stop calling you
You-"Flash!! Stop calling me!! I don't want to talk to you!!"
Flash-"You may not want to talk to me but you'll want to listen, I'm too much of a coward to
tell you this in person, but I'm very sorry for all I've done, in counseling I've realized that
being close to you, even in proximity is pretty nice, and I wanted to tell you I like you, thats
all."
Flash hangs up
You- "WHAT?!"
The next day at school is pretty awkward
All day you are on edge, waiting to see what Flash does, finally you see him and tell him
You-"Flash I don't like you"
Flash-"Yeah you do that's why we're dating"
You-"No we aren't?"
Flash pulls your collar harshly
Flash-"Yes we are"
"Omg this guy is legit crazy!!" you think "How do I get out of this one?!"
You are forced into a relationship with Flash, who knows why, if only you had told Mrs.Andrews
what he had been doing to you. Sorry!
BAD END
'''
let_the_boy_help = '''
You-"Thanks for helping me ...?"
Mystery boy-"No problem, its Phoenix by the way"
You-"Nice to meet you Phoenix, I'm Aiden"
Phoenix-"You too Aiden, hopefully I'll see you around"
You-"See you Phoenix"
He helps you with your books and goes to class, you get up and do the same.

After the school day is over you relaize the boy has alot of classes with you

You start talking to him more and more and realize he's a cool guy, so you become friends

Flash notices this and decides to do something about it

One day afterschool you're walking home with Phoenix talking about an explosion that almost
happened in chemistry when Flash appears in front of you two, scowling
Flash-"So you've got yourself a friend huh? You the new boy?"
You-"You don't have to answer to people like him Phoenix, lets go"
You and Phoenix try to walk around Flash, but he grabs Phoenix by the collar
Flash-"Phoenix? Like the bird? Well let's see if you can fly out of this!"
Flash pulls his arm back ready to punch Phoenix in the face
You can either help Phoenix, or run away
Which will you choose?
'''
shoo_him_away = '''
You don't let the boy help you:
You-"Hey, I don't need your help! Go away!"
New boy-"Wow I was just trying to be nice, no need to be such a jerk!"
The boy walks off, "whatever" you think "noone told him to help anyway"

A few weeks later the new boy who had tried to help you with your books has gotten awfuly close
to Flash, and is the talk of the school, something about them being "the terrible two"
they say.
As you walk to your class you bump into Flash and he looks down at you
Flash-"Hey look here Phoenix, looks like we've got a catch!"
The boy named Phoenix, aka "new boy" looks at you and snickers
Phoenix-"I remember him, I tried to help him when I first got here and he shoo'd me off like
an annoying pigeon"
Flash-"Oh really? Why don't we get some payback for you!"
Flash pushes you down while Phoenix slams your books down and scatters them everywhere
Phoenix-"Now who will help you?"
Flash-"Ha! Nice one babe!"
"Babe?!" you think
You-"You two are dating?!"
Flash-"Yep! Who would've thought I only bullied you because I liked you, now I have a real man
on my side!"
Flash states this and runs out of the building with Phoenix to ditch class
You lay on the floor and realize hoe you now have noone and wish you would have accepted Phoenix's
help when you had it, now you have two bullies and noone to fight them with. Sorry!
BAD END
'''

run_away = '''
You run as fast as you can into the school to look for help, anybody in power, heck even a janitor
would be of use, just then, you see your counselor
You-"Mrs.Andrews! Come quickly Flash is beating up Phoenix!"
Mrs.Andrews-"Oh my! Lead the way Aiden!!"
you lead the way to the scene of the fight
when you both arrive you see Flash and Phoenix on the ground,bloody Flash on top of Phoenix
slugging him
Mrs.Andrews-"Flash! Get off of him!"
Mrs.Andrews had studied anatomy before going into counseling and knew all of the bodies pressure
points, so she grabbed the one on Flash's neck and relaxed him a bit, long enough for you to
pull Phoenix out from Flash's grip
You-"Phoenix! Phoenix, oh my gosh your eye is purple! Phoenix are you ok?! What did he hurt?!
Are you bleeding?!"
Phoenix-"I broke the idiot's nose but I think he broke my arm"
You-"Oh jeez, Mrs.Anderson, Phoenix has a broken arm and Flash has a broken nose!"
Mrs.Anderson- "the ambulance is on the way, I'm calling both of their parents now to let them know"

The ambulance arrives and takes Phoenix and Flash, you try to stay with Phoenix but the
Nurses tell you its only family for now, so you get your bike and ride to the hospital to wait
until you're able to see him.

Three hours later after Flash's,Phoenix's, and your parents come to see the damage they
let you in, you run in to see Phoenix in his dressing gown with a cast on his left arm, looking
at the window to his left, he hears you come in and smiles
Phoenix-"Look!" he says lifting up his cast for you to see
Phoenix-"It's a clean cast, and I'm gonna let you sign first!" He hands you the sharpie he asked
the doctor for earlier still smiling
You walk up to him and sit in the chair next to his bed,
You-"Phoenix I'm so sorry, I should've helped you out back there, yet I ran away for help,
like a wimp or something! I understand if you don't really want to be friends annymore, I'll
give you back the cds you let me borrow and everything"
Phoenix looks at you confused
Phioenix-"Why would I be mad? You got someone to help when you knew you couldn't, you probably would've
gotten more hurt than I did, plus, did you see how fast Flash dropped?! That was so cool!"
You perk up, a bit, knowing you're friend isn't mad at you, and sign his cast, happy that you
can still call Phoenix your friend.

The next week in school when Phoenix returns, you and him walk into school and get a standing
ovation, everyone is shocked Phoenix were able to give Flash Bunswick a broken nose, which gains both
of you major popularity.

FLash returns to school as the main joke of the school
During lunch everyone is still laughing at him so you stand on top of the table and make a big speech
about how even though Flash was a jerk to most of you guys, the laughing has been going on for
long enough, "its time to be mature" You say.
After an awkward silence everyone starts murmuring in agreement, and tell you how cool you are
for being a bigger person.
After school Flash comes up to you to apologize for all he's done to you and says he deserves
what Phoenix did to him, and tells you that you're actually not a bad person and wishes you the best

Looks like the rest of highschool will be a breeze!
HAPPY END
'''

help_Phoenix = '''
 You help Phoenix:
 You run up and grab Flash's arm before he can punch Phoenix
 You-"Flash!! What are you doing?! He hasn't done anything to you!!"
 Flash-"Yes he has! He befriended you! So I'm gonna scar him to think better!!"
 Phoenix-"Step back Aiden!" He pushes you out of the way and punches Flash's side so he lets
 Phoenix go, then grabs you and runs
 You-"My house is close! We can go there!"
 You two go to your house and hide out there
 Phoenix-"Thanks for defending me, that was pretty cool"
 Aiden-"Yeah, thanks for shoving me, that was ok I guess??"
 You both laugh and play games, glad you helped Phoenix, you can rest easy knowing your friend
 is safe.

 The next day in school, Flash ignores you and Phoenix completely
 Phoenix-"Guess that punch shut him up huh? Heh heh heh"
 You-"I guess so ha ha"
 Phoenix-"Listen Aiden, I gotta tell you something after school, meet me at the field after
 school ok?"
 You-"Oh, sure yeah see you then."
You go to all your classes for the day wondering what Phoenix has to tell you.

After School:
You go to the field as soon as you're done with all your classes and see Phoenix waiting for
you by the gate.
Phoenix-"Hey"
You-"Hey, what'd you need to tell me?"
Phoenix-"Well, initially it was one thing but now it's two, first off its about Flash"
You-"I thought he was done with us?"
Phoenix-"He is, but he wanted you to know the reason he bullied you"
You-"it's because I'm gay right? I already know that-"
Phoenix-"No Aiden, its because he likes you"
You-"Oh,wow"
Phoenix-"Yeah...how do you feel?"
You-"Disgusted actually, he could've told me way before all of this and avoided this completely!"
Phoenix-"Do you like him?"
You-"What? Ewe, no, hoow could I like a jerk like him?"
Phoenix gives a relieved sigh
Phoenix-"Good cause that would've made things awkward"
You-"How? Its not like I talk to him at all"
Phoenix-"No between you and me"
You-"How?"
Phoenix-"Because Aiden, I like you"
Aiden-"You're gay??"
Phoenix-"Yes, you made me realize"
You-"Wow, well you're welcome?"
Phoenix-"Heh, thanks"
Phoenix-"Well, what do you say?"
Do you want to be with Phoenix? Type yes or no.
 '''
yes = '''
You want to be with Phoenix:
You-"What? Of course I'll be your boyfriend, you're great!"
Phoenix-"Really! Oh man this is great, let's take our first couple selfie!"
You-"Lol ok"
You take the picture and Phoenix walks you home, little did you know, Flash was nearby, listening
to your answer to see where he would stand, when he heard how you felt, he realized what he
had done and felt awful about it, so he went home and had a good long look at himself and resolved
that he would never be enough for you because of what he had done to you, so he lived with that
pain, and knew it would never go away.
SUPER HAPPY END
'''

no = '''
You don't want to be with Phoenix:
You-"Um, sorry Phoenix, I don't really see you as anymore than a friend"
Phoenix-"Oh, ok, um that's fine I guess, but I just wanna know something."
You-"Yeah, what is it?"
Phoenix-"Do you like someone else?"
You-"No, I just, don't want to be with anyone yet, that's all, I hope we can still be friends?"
Phoenix-"Of course we can Aiden, our friendship could never end, no matter what"
You-"Good"
Phoenix-"It's getting late, I'll walk you home"
You-"Thanks man"
Phoenix walks with you off the field telling you about his day, relieved about what you said
because what you didn't know was that Flash was hiding behind the bleachers in the field, also
waiting for your response, but it was only half of what he wanted
In his perfect world you would've declared your liking of him, because he liked you but
never knew how to tell you that's why he always bullied you
Silly right?
Well, that's Flash for you.
FRIENDLY END
'''

accept_his_feelings = '''
You accept Flash's feelings:
"So that's why he's always been like this" You think "He likes me, but I can't be with him
at this point in my life, not after all he's done to me."
You- "I can't be with you like you want me to right now, not after you made my life this
miserable."
Flash-"How about friends? Can we be friends? I promise I won't hurt you anymore."
You-"What about your friends, won't they hate you for being with me? Even as friends?"
Flash-"I've come to the realization that those guys aren't my friends, they're bad influences
and bad people, and I no longer want to be associated with them, I don't think they'll
really care anyway."
You-"...fine, I'll be your friend."
Flash-"Really! Sweet!"
From there you realized underneath all the bad layers he had, he was a good person who was turned
bad. You had made loads of new friends from clubs you had joined, and with Flash no longer a problem, you had become super confident.
Flash's friends didn't really like him as much anymore either, so they didn't really
talk to him anymore, so that he could be a good person now, he made ammends with other people
he bullied and soon enough they forgave him too After a while of hanging out with him
you realized you actually had feelings for him, and when graduation came around,
you were the school's "it couple" and all was well.
SUPER HAPPY END
'''

deny_his_feelings = '''
You deny Flash's feelings:
You-"What? You? Like me? You, the person who made me contemplate life it's self, like me!
Of all people! Wow kid you're a riot! As if I would date someone so sinsiter!"
Flash-"...ok" He walks away and for the next few days he avoids you in the halls, you take it
he doesn't even want to bully you, not afetr being rejected like that, so you take this time
to make some new friends, you join some clubs, pick up guitar again, bring your grades up, and
everything is well in your life again.
FRIENDLY END

Your name is Logan. You have just moved to sunny southern California from London, England.
You cant wait to get out there and make some new friends!
'''

#L_BOY_NEXT_DOOR_NAME = ''' Logan'''

#L_BOY_ON_BUS_NAME = '''Jacob'''

L_BOY_NEXT_DOOR = '''
Congrats! You met your first friend since moving to California, Peter. You guys quickly
become great friends and you find out more about him. He is really funny and smart. You
get the feeling he's a bit of a nerd butyou dont mind because he is your best friend.
'''

L_BOY_ON_BUS = '''
Wow, you waited all week to finally meet someone your age on the bus to school. You sit
down in an empty row and soon more kids get on and the bus is filling up. Suddenly a new
boy comes and sits next to you. He introduces himself as Jacob. You guy become very close
and great friends. He lives a few blocks away and you guys hangout all the time. He is
pretty nerdy when it comes to science but it comes in handy when you guys are lab partners.
'''
L_BULLIES = '''
Your best friend is going to be bullied. Does he get bullied by the jocks or does he get
bullied by some fake friends?
'''

L_JOCKS1 = '''
Some jocks walk up to the two of you in the hallway and try to make Peter do their homework.
They threaten to hurt him if he doesn't. But you have no idea what to do!!!

'''

L_NEW_FRIENDS1 = '''
A few months after school starts some people from the super popular table come to
sit with you because they want to learn more about England and to hear your accent.
You try not to notice but you see the new people pushing Peter away and you dont know
how to stop it. Peter gets depressed becasue you could do nothing but stand by and
watch the bullying take place.

L_FAIL = '''
You didn't do anything and therefore have failed your best friend when he needed
you most. But now you have a chance to make it up to him. What will you do?
'''

L_ADULT = '''
You chose to tell an adult that you friend was being bullied but it doesn't work. Your
friend doesn't trust you anymore. You're so sad and you best friend doesnt like you so
much anymore. you have shattered all the wonderful trust in your relationship.

Later that night you read online that according to statistics only about 4%  of adults
will truly step in when they see bullying. They ususally undermine the problems that will
come from the result of bullying.

This doesn't make you feel any better about not standing up but now you know what you
should do next time.
'''

L_STAND_UP = '''
You are a great best friend! YOu stood up for him and now you guys are just destined to
be Best Friends For Life!!!!! YOu guys will be there though all the hard and easy times. You
are now #bestfriendgoals. Congrats!!! Please make sure to stand up everytime and to be there
forever, your friendship is a one of a kind, once in a lifetime, unique, and a once in a blue
moon kind of friendship. Enjoy it!!!!
'''

L_BESTMAN = '''
You are the best. You chose to comfort your friend in his time of need. You were there for him even
if he didnt always need you. So when the time came, many years later...

You made the right decisions and now you are his best man (maybe husband) at
his wedding. YOu both look great and the whole ceremony is wonderful. Everyone is only smiles
and the speeches put you both to tears. It's the mark of the rest of your lives together always.
Maybe married maybe not ;)
'''

L_DEATH_1 = '''
After getting bullied and not having you there for comfort, he gets fully diagnosed with a serious
depression disorder. He is admitted to a mental institiute but you barely notice him not there anymore
with all the new frinds you have. So on your way into your house a few months later you head to the
mailbox to check the mail and right on top are two letters addressed to you. The first is a handwritten
letter. You think it looks cooler so you open it first. This is what it reads:
    Dear Logan,
            You have been my best friend and I know that you will go really far in life. You are smart
            and so cool. When we first met I knew my life would never be the same again. And I was right.
            Please don't blame your self, none of this is your fault! You just wanted some new friends and
            I totally understand that. I forgive you for casting me aside and for not helping when I was
            hurting.
            I hope you will rethink your decisions when you make a new friend and that you treat them
            better but I understand that I wasn't cool enough for you anymore. Please comfort my family
            in their time of pain and I'll make sure that they dont blame you. No one blames you, least
            of all you.
            I hope you know that you were my best friend and that i am so happy to have known you for the
            short time that I did. Please don't easily forget me.
                                Your Best Friend,
                                    Peter

You are in tears now and scared of what the second letter is but you open it anyway. Inside is the
following note:
        To Logan,
            You are invited to attend the funeral of Peter this friday.
            We hope you will attend and maybe say a few words, we are aware you two were very close
            and to honor his memory we would like you to talk to his character before his upseting
            and young demise.
        From The Family of Peter

Your life shatters and you regret anything you would have done accidentily to harm him in anyway. You
know your mistakes and you know you will now never let anyone you know be bullied and you will protect
everyone you love from the same outcome.
